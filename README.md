**An on-device AI agent that also works on your own computers.**

Pico is a modified version of [OpenMinis](https://github.com/OpenMinis/OpenMinis), changed since
2026-10-17. It keeps everything OpenMinis does on the phone (leading models, a Linux shell on the
device, browser automation, skills, memory and system integration) and adds a computer of your own
for the agent to work on: a Mac or Linux machine you reach over SSH.

---

## What Pico adds

| | |
|---|---|
| **Remote computers** | Bind a chat to a host and its shell and file tools run there, over SSH. Long commands keep running while iOS suspends the app. |
| **Pairing by scan** | Run `minis-hostd pair` on the computer and scan its code in Pico; no keys to copy or fingerprints to compare. |
| **The host's browser** | The agent drives ego lite on the host, with your logins there, through `ego-browser`. |
| **The host's screen** | View and control the computer's screen in the app, and let the agent see and click it; taking control pauses the agent. |
| **Proactive push** | `minis-hostd` watches your mail and GitHub, pushes what needs you, and a tap opens a read-only session that explains it. |

Design, decisions and acceptance results: **[docs/remote-agent](docs/remote-agent/README.md)**.
The host daemon: **[host/minis-hostd](host/minis-hostd/README.md)**.

## From OpenMinis

| | |
|---|---|
| **Bring your own model** | Claude, GPT, Gemini and other providers, via your own API keys or account sign-in. |
| **A real Linux shell** | A sandboxed Alpine Linux environment runs on-device. The agent can install packages, run scripts, and work with real files. |
| **Device integration** | Health, Calendar, Reminders, Contacts, HomeKit, Bluetooth, Clipboard, Media, Alarms and more, exposed to the agent as tools. |
| **Browser automation** | The agent can browse and interact with the web on your behalf. |
| **Skills & memory** | Extensible skills plus persistent memory across sessions. |
| **Workspaces** | Organise work into separate contexts, addressable via `minis://workspace/`. |
| **Native offloads** | Heavy or platform-specific work is handed to native code instead of the sandbox. |

Skills built for Claude, Codex, OpenClaw or Hermes Agent generally run as-is. OpenMinis keeps a
collection adapted to its tools in **[OpenMinis/MinisSkills](https://github.com/OpenMinis/MinisSkills)**,
and use cases in **[OpenMinis/AwesomeMinis](https://github.com/OpenMinis/AwesomeMinis)**; both work
in Pico.

## Install on your iPhone

Pico is not in the App Store. Build it from source and install it on your own device:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/NoSugarCoffee/Pico.git
cd Pico
# build the native dependencies once, as in BUILDING.md, then:
scripts/ios-personal-device.sh --team <TEAM_ID> --prefix <com.you.pico> --device <device id>
```

The script rewrites upstream's bundle id, App Group and iCloud container to your prefix and drops
the entitlements your team cannot sign. It installs as **Pico**, so it sits beside an OpenMinis
install without either taking the other's links.

Then put the host daemon on your computer:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NoSugarCoffee/Pico/main/host/minis-hostd/scripts/install.sh \
  | sh -s -- --pair --version <version>
```

and scan the code it prints in Pico: Settings → Remote Hosts → Add Host.

---

## Building from source

Pico ships OpenMinis's Linux sandbox inside the app, so the native dependencies (iSH on iOS, PRoot
on Android, FFmpeg, LAME, rclone) and the Alpine rootfs are **built from source** rather than
committed as binaries.

**→ See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for the full first-build guide.**

The short version:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/NoSugarCoffee/Pico.git
cd Pico

# iOS  — needs Go 1.25+ and Xcode's Metal Toolchain
#        (xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain)
#        order matters: FFmpeg links against LAME
./deps/build_lame.sh && ./deps/build_ffmpeg.sh
./deps/build_ish.sh && ./deps/prepare_alpine_rootfs.sh
./deps/build_rclone_ios.sh
open src/ios/Minis.xcodeproj

# Android — needs NDK r28+, Go 1.25+ and gomobile
./deps/build_proot.sh && ./scripts/prepare_android_sandbox.sh
./deps/build_rclone_android.sh
mkdir -p src/android/app/libs && cp deps/build/rclone/rclone.aar src/android/app/libs/
cd src/android && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

Internal names (`Minis.xcodeproj`, `com.openminis.app`, `minis-hostd`, `~/.minis`) are
upstream's and stay that way, so OpenMinis changes keep merging into Pico.

## Built on OpenMinis

Pico exists because OpenMinis is free and open source. The app, its sandbox, its tools and most of
this repository are OpenMinis's work.

## Acknowledgements

Pico, like OpenMinis, stands on a great deal of open-source work. Our thanks to the OpenMinis
authors, and to the maintainers of these projects — the full inventory, with versions and license
terms, is in [THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md](THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md).

**The sandbox** — the heart of the product:

- **[iSH](https://github.com/ish-app/ish)** (GPLv3) — Linux usermode emulation on

  Android sandbox, via [the OpenMinis fork](https://github.com/OpenMinis/proot);
  **[talloc](https://talloc.samba.org)** (LGPLv3+) underpins it.
- **[Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org)** — the minirootfs the sandbox boots.

## License

Pico is licensed under the **[GNU General Public License v3.0](LICENSE)**, as OpenMinis is.
It is a modified version of OpenMinis; the changes since 2026-10-17 are in this repository's
history.

The app links GPL-licensed components — [iSH](https://github.com/OpenMinis/ish-arm64)
(GPLv3) and [PRoot](https://github.com/OpenMinis/proot) (GPLv2) — so the combined
work is distributed under GPLv3. Bundled third-party licenses are listed in
[THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md](THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md).
